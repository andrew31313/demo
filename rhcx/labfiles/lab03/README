OBJECTIVE
In this lab, you will practice some of the commands that you learnt on chapter 3. But make sure that you go through the exercises on the book and the lab on the video.


SETUP
Before beginning the lab, follow these steps to prepare the hosts indicated
(these steps assume a cleanly installed host OS and VMs):

  Host OS:

  server1:

  server2:

  labipa:

STEPS:

   # Practice to check the different mounts on the machine, checking the volume/ space on the connected devices.
   # Using Links and copying and moving files.

	1. Create directory with the name bar and inside the directory create an empty file drinks.
	2. Create another directory that is not inside bar named club.
	3. Create another empty file name it uber not inside bar or club.
	4. Create a Symbolic link on bar and club.
	5. Create a Hard link on uber and ./bar/uber.
	6. vim into uber and  add the text " Hey, get ready. ".
	7. Create a file inside club named music.
	8. In the bar directory vim into uber and add the text " Safe driving inside". and safe, exit.
	9. using tar compress the file bar to a new compresses file bar.tar.
	10. View the contents on bar.tar without unzipping then after this unzip the file.

			
     # Make sure that your double check to see if the links work. You can use ls -il to see the list including the inode number to make sure that 
           uber and bar/uber have the same inode number and in bar you can see the lines that were added. and also in bar or uber you can not see the new file that you 
               created on club.
