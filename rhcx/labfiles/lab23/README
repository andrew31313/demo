=== LAB 23: Fix showmount
OBJECTIVE
The warning at the bottom of p521 says firewalls can break the showmount
command and that is the case with our machines.  In this lab, you will learn
to fix that.

SETUP
No setup is necessary but cleanly installed VMs are assumed.

STEPS
1.  Login to server2 as root and run "showmount -e labipa.example.com"
2.  Fix the firewall rules so the showmount command works
