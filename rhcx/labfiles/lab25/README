=== LAB 25: Convert epoch timestamps to human readable timestamps

OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice translating epoch time into human readable time.

STEPS

1.  As root, run the following command to get the timestamps of all the system
    boots and user logins from the audit log:

      awk '/type=(SYSTEM_BOOT|USER_LOGIN)/ { print $1, $2 }' \
        /var/log/audit/audit.log

2.  Convert the epoch timestamps to human readable timestamps.
3.  Run the "last" command to verify you were able to convert the timestamps
    correctly.
