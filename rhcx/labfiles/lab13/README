=== LAB 13: Setup Password-less SSH

OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you create a key pair so you can log into server2 without a
password and use the logs to troubleshoot the issues encountered.

SETUP

Log into server2 as the root user and run:
    
  ansible-playbook /labfiles/lab05/setup-server2-DONT_LOOK
    
Do not look at setup-server2-DONT_LOOK as it contains spoilers.

STEPS

1.  Login to server1 as the user, "user" and generate a keypair
2.  Configure server2 for passwordless SSH logins
3.  Use the logs to help troubleshoot any issues encountered
