=== LAB 17: Change the default "runlevel"
OBJECTIVE
In this lab, you will practice changing the state you want the machine to
boot to by default.

SETUP
No setup is necessary but you should start with a cleanly installed server2 VM.

STEPS
Server2 starts with a "Minimal" server installation of CentOS 7.  If you
install the "Server With GUI" environment, you will notice that it 
still does not boot into a graphical interface when rebooted.  Change that.
1.  Install the "Server With GUI" package group.
2.  Change the default systemd target
