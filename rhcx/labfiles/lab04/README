=== LAB 04: (Working With Text Files)

OBJECTIVE:

In this lab, you will practice using text files and searching by:

  - Creating empty files
  - Editing files
  - Displaying contents of the file
  - Searching in a man page.
  - Searching with grep, sed, or awk and using the pipe command.
  - View processes running
  

STEPS:

[Working step] Log into GCP and spin up CentOS.

  1. Open up the man page for the 'cat' command using the less command.
  2. Search for GNU.
  3. Exit the man page.
  4. Now search for GNU without opening up the man page first. (Hint: A pipe is used here).
  5. Using the same method as Step 4, search for anything with a G in it.
  6. Create an empty file named List.txt and echo "404: Text not found."
  7. Create a new directory named Grocery and move List.txt into the new directory.
  8. Delete the directory with the file in it. Do NOT delete List.txt first.
  9. Display the processes that are running on the terminal.
