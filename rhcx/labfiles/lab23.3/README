=== LAB 23.3: Automount Kerberized NFS home directories
OBJECTIVE
Get hands on practice setting up autofs to mount user home directories on
demand.  Kerberized NFS exports are used to ensure security.

SETUP
Ensure all VMs are running.  This lab assumes you have already finished lab23.2
successfully, specifically, you have already configured the hosts for
Kerberized NFS.

After completing lab23.2, you will want to remove the /home/ldap entry from
/etc/fstab, unmount /home/ldap, and then remove the /home/ldap directory before
starting the lab below.

STEPS
1.  On server2, configure /home/ldap as the automount location, using krb5p, for
    the /home/ldap share expored from labipa
2.  Use "su - ldapuser1" followed by "pwd" to confirm you have changed ID and
    are now in the automatically mounted home directory for the user
3.  Verify you have write access to the ldapuser1 home directory when you are
    the ldapuser1 user
