=== LAB 18.2: Troubleshooting the boot process

OBJECTIVE
In this lab, you will troubleshoot a machine that won't boot.  You will
know you have successfully completed the lab when you can boot the machine

SETUP
Before beginning the lab, follow these steps to prepare the hosts indicated
(these steps assume a cleanly installed host OS and VMs):

  server2:
    Log into server2 as root and run:
      ansible-playbook /labfiles/lab19/setup-server2-DONT_LOOK
    This will break the machine.  As the name implies, don't look at
    setup-server2-DONT_LOOK as that will give away how the machine was
    broken and figuring that out is the point of the exercise

STEPS
1. Get server2 working again.
