=== RHCSA Practice
SETUP
This is a practice exam that provides a couple of VMs and a scenario that
requires practical knowledge similar to what is required to pass the RHCSA.

  Host OS:
    Run ./setup.sh in the current directory to create two new VMs that
    will run on their own NAT network.  They will not interact with the VMs
    we using in our other labs (labipa, server1 and server2) but you may
    want to shut them down so you have more available RAM.

SCENARIO
Your company is setting up an install (PXE) server so users can reinstall their
CentOS workstations at will.  It's a small company so the same server will be
used for DHCP and TFTP of the PXE boot image.  The DHCP server has already been
configured to hand out 192.168.5.x/24 addresses and DHCP options needed for PXE
(e.g. "nextserver" is the DHCP parameter containing the IP address the PXE
firmware contacts via TFTP to download a bootable image).  However, the admin
who was setting up the server just won the lottery and promptly quit, leaving
only her unfinished todo list behind.  Please use this list to finish setting
up the server.  Note, the previous admin has already done a lot of work
creating config files in /root and configuring DHCP so, if you run into
problems (she mentioned leaving a going away "present" for her replacement),
you will want to fix them rather than reinstall and lose all her work.  Rumor
has it the previous admin is relaxing on her own private beach somewhere so we
have not been able to confirm whether or not this list is complete so there may
be steps that need to be done in addtion to those listed below.  These are the
requirements (after the Installation server has been rebooted):

- The installation server gets software from
  http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/
- The installation server gets updates from
  http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/
- The workstation can configure its networking via DHCP
- The workstation can download the files hosted by tftp 

ToDo List (x = finished)
x Install dnsmasq (handles both DNS and DHCP services)
x Configure DNS/DHCP settings in dnsmasq.conf to hand out correct network info
  including PXE boot options
x Configure dnsmasq to start on boot
x Create the PXE boot menu (default and graphics.conf are in ~)
x Create a kickstart file to automate the install of the workstations
  (~/ks/ks.cfg)
x install tftpd and make sure the it's enabled at boot
- create the /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux/pxelinux.cfg directory
- copy /usr/share/syslinux/pxelinux.0 to /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux
- copy /usr/share/syslinux/menu.c32 to /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux/
- copy ~/vmlinuz and ~/initrd.img to /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux/
- copy ~/default and ~/graphics.conf to /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux/pxelinux.cfg
- install httpd
- Move the ~/ks directory to the httpd document root
