=== RHCSA Practice
This is a practice exam that provides a couple of VMs and a scenario that
requires practical knowledge similar to what is required to pass the RHCSA.

SETUP
  Host OS:
    Change to ~/demo/rhcx and run "vagrant halt" to stop all VMs.  The run
    "vagrant up --no-parallel labipa-8 exam1 exam2" to start the three VMs
    used in this practice exam.  The exam assumes labipa-8 still has its
    default configuration.

INSTRUCTIONS
Login to exam1 as root and complete the tasks in /root/README.  You should be
able to complete all exam tasks in 2.5 hours.

Good luck!
