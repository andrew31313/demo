=== LAB 24: Firewalls and NFS RPCs (showmount and rpcinfo)

OBJECTIVE

The warning in the middle of p516 says firewalls can break the showmount
command and that is the case with our machines.  In this lab, you will learn
to fix that.

STEPS

1.  Login to server2 as root and run "showmount -e labipa.example.com" to find
    that it actually does work
2.  Login to labipa and check the status of the firewall to verify it is, in
    fact, running
3.  View the firewall rules to see if you can figure out why showmount works
    when the book suggests it should be broken
4.  If you think if found the answer, change the firewall rules temporarily to
    test your hypothesis
