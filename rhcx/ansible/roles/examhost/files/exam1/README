Follow these steps in order:

1. Configure the unconfigured network interface to use the following settings:
     IP Address: 192.168.4.101
     Netmask: 255.255.255.0
     Gateway: 192.168.4.1
     DNS: 192.168.4.200
     (HINT: If you reboot, the hostname should be set correctly)

2. SSH to exam2.example.com as root and complete the tasks in /root/README
   (password: password)

Note: you will not be able to login to the console on exam2 so you must get
      network configuration above correct to continue.
