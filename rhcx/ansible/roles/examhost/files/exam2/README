Complete the tasks below in any order you like (However, the order in which you
complete the tasks may make the exam esier or harder).

- Make sure SELinux is set to enforcing.

- Make sure the firewall is enabled.

- Configure sshd to listen to port 2022 and disable password authentication.

- Create a 4GB logical volume named tftpboot in the existing volume group,
  format it with XFS, and make sure it gets mounted on /var/lib/tftpboot when
  the system is booted.

- Your yum repo for BaseOS should use this mirrorlist URL:                       
  http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=$releasever&arch=$basearch&repo=BaseOS&infra=$infra
  (Tip: After this, reinstall the centos-release package to reenable the         
  other default yum repositories).

- Install the syslinux package, the Apache server, xinetd, and a TFTP server.

- Ensure the Apache web server, xinetd, and tftp are started when the system 
  boots and are accessible through the firewall.

- Extract the files in /root/pxeconf.tar relative to the /var directory.

- Copy the following files from /usr/share/syslinux to
  /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux:
  - pxelinux.0
  - ldlinux.c32
  - menu.c32
  - libutil.c32

- Download vmlinuz and initrd.img from
  http://mirror.centos.org/centos/8/BaseOS/x86_64/os/isolinux/ and move them to
  /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux/.

- Create a 2GB logical volume named data in the existing volume group,
  format it with ext4, and make sure it gets mounted on /var/data by UUID when
  the system is booted.

- Create users xavier, jed, and hastin.  Make xavier and jed members of a group
  named accounting and hastin a member of a group named auditors.  Set their
  passwords to "password" and force them to change their passwords on the next 
  login.

- Ensure all current and future files under /var/data will belong to the
  accounting group.

- Ensure all current and future files under /var/data are readable and writable
  by members of accounting and readable by members of auditors.  Nobody outside
  these two groups should have access (other than root).  Also ensure members
  of accounting can delete only the files belonging to them.
