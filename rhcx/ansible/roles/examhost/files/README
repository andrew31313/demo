- Make sure SELinux is set to enforcing

- Make sure the firewall is enabled

- Create a 4GB logical volume named tftpboot in the existing volume group,
  format it with XFS, and make sure it gets mounted on /var/lib/tftpboot when
  the system is booted

- Your yum repo for BaseOS should use this mirrorlist URL:                       
  http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=$releasever&arch=$basearch&repo=BaseOS&infra=$infra
  (Tip: After this, reinstall the centos-release package to reenable the         
  other default yum repositories)                                               

- Install the syslinux package, the Apache server, xinetd, and a TFTP server

- Ensure the Apache web server, xinetd, and tftp are started when the system 
  boots and are accessible through the firewall

- Extract the files in /root/pxeconf.tar relative to the /var directory

- Copy the following files from /usr/share/syslinux to /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux:
  - pxelinux.0
  - ldlinux.c32
  - menu.c32
  - libutil.c32

- Download vmlinuz and initrd.img from
  http://mirror.centos.org/centos/8/BaseOS/x86_64/os/isolinux/ them in
  /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux/
