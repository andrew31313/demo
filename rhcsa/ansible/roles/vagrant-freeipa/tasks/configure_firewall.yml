# Assume the default is a host with a single interface on an internal network.
# Make sure the default zone to which rules are applied and the system uses is
# the "internal" zone. The default will be to allow inbound ssh in the internal
# zone and any other service requirements need to be handled by the service
# playbooks. Also make sure any task manipulating the firewall notifies the
# "reload firewall" handler.
