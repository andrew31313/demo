Follow these steps in order:

1. Configure the unconfigured network interface to use the following settings:
     IP Address: 192.168.4.101
     Netmask: 255.255.255.0
     Gateway: 192.168.4.1
     DNS: 8.8.8.8

2. Add the following entries to /etc/hosts:
     192.168.4.101 exam1.example.com exam1
     192.168.4.102 exam2.example.com exam2

3. Verify you can SSH to exam2.example.com as root (password: password)

4. Logout of exam2 and, back on exam1, generate an SSH keypair, upload the
   public key to exam2, and verify you can login to exam2 without a password

5. After completing the steps above, SSH to exam2.example.com as root and
   complete the tasks in /root/README

Note: You will not be able to login to the console on exam2 so you must get
      configuration above correct to continue.
