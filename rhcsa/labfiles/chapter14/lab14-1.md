# lab14-1: Managing Partitions
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice using disk partitioning tools.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS

1.  Locate the currently unused disk on server2
1.  Create two partitions on the unused drive, a 2GB partition, and a partition containing the rest of the disk
1.  Format the 2GB partition as a Linux swap partition and activate it
1.  Create a /backup directory
1.  Format the other partition as an xfs partition and mount it to /backup
1.  Once you have confirmed the swap partition can be activated and the xfs partition can be mounted, ensure the file system is mounted by label when the system boots (reboot to test this)
