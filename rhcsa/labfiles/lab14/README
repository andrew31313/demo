=== LAB 14: Managing Partitions

OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice using disk partitioning tools.

STEPS

- Locate the currently unused disk on server2
- Create two partitions on the unused drive, a 2GB partition, and a partition
  containing the rest of the disk
- Format the 2GB partition as a Linux swap partition and activate it
- Create a /backup directory
- Format the other partition as an xfs partition and mount it to /backup
- Once you have confirmed the swap partition can be activated and the xfs
  partition can be mounted, ensure they come up that way when the system boots
