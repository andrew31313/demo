=== LAB 13: Practice confirguring rsyslogd

OBJECTIVE

Make sure you know how to configure system logging

STEPS
You should be able to do this on any virtual machine or the host OS.
1.  Look at /etc/rsyslog.conf and see if you can tell where the local4 facility
    will log messages of priority "info" or higher
2.  Test your guess using:

      logger -p local4.warn "Testing local4 warnings"

3.  Change the configuration so that local4.debug messages and higher also log
    to /var/log/local4.log
4.  Check your work using:

      logger -p local4.debug "Testing local4 debug messages"

    Verify your message appears in /var/log/local4.log but not in the original
    log destination
5.  Configure logrotate to rotate the file daily and keep only 5 days worth of
    logs.
6.  Remember to undo your changes before the logs fill the harddrive
