# lab18-2: Troubleshoot the boot process
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will troubleshoot a machine that won't boot.  You will know you have successfully completed the lab when you can boot the machine

## SETUP

Log into server2 and run:

```ansible-playbook -K /labfiles/chapter18/setup-server2-DONT_LOOK2```

This will break the machine.  As the name implies, don't look at ```setup-server2-DONT_LOOK2``` as that will give away how the machine was broken and figuring that out is the point of the exercise

## STEPS

1. Get server2 working again.
