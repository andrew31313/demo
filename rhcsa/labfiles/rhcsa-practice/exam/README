This is a practice exam that provides a couple of VMs and a scenario that
requires practical knowledge similar to what is required to pass the RHCSA.

virtual machines.  The run "vagrant up --no-parallel labipa exam1 exam2" to
start the three virtual machines used in this practice exam.  The exam assumes
labipa still has its default configuration.
