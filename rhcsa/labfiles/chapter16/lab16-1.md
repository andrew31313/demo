# lab16-1: Learn Basic Kernel Management
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice finding information about which kernel and 
distribution you are using and working with kernel modules.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS
On server2:
1.  Find the version of the kernel you are currently running
1.  Find your distribution version
1.  Display a list of currently loaded kernel modules
1.  Delete /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.dep and recreate it
1.  If serio_raw is not loaded into memory, load it
1.  Now unload serio_raw
1.  Who is the author of the serio_raw module and how is it licensed?
1.  What parameters can be passed to the e1000 module when it's loaded

### OPTIONAL
If you want to try these out, you will need to shutdown server2 and add USB to the virtual machine settings first.
1.  Run the dmesg command, attach or dettach a USB device, and run dmesg again
1.  Attach and dettach USB devices while running udevadm monitor
