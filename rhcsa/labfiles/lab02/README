=== LAB 02: Using Essential Tools - Vim

OBJECTIVE:

In this lab, you will practice using vim to do the following:

- Replace text
- Move to a specific line
- Copy text
- Paste text
- Changing the file name
- Undoing and Redoing commands
- Deleting a line of text
- Deleteing one character at a time
- Save without exiting
- Exit without saving
- Saving and exiting   

STEPS:

You can do this lab on the host or in any of the VMs.

1. Create a file in vim named training.txt
2. Add the following lines to the file:
      
  Strawberry
  Banana      

3. Exit vim without saving. If you take a look at your files, training.txt should not appear since we didn't save the file.
4. Create training.txt using vim again.
5. Add the following lines to the file:
      
  Strawberry
  Banana
  Raspberry
  Coco
  Blueberries
      
6. Replace 'Coco' with 'Coconut'.
7. Delete 'Blueberries'.
8. Undo the deletion of 'Blueberries'
9. Save the contents to a new file named 'Smoothie.txt'
10. Save and exit vim.

For additional practice, run "vimtutor" on the command line instead of vim.
This will open a practice doc in vim that you can read and edit simultaneously.
It will take around 30 minutes to complete.
