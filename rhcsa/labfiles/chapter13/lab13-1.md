# lab13-1: Practice configuring rsyslogd
## OBJECTIVE

Make sure you know how to configure system logging

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS
Complete the following steps on server2:
1. Look at ```/etc/rsyslog.conf``` and see if you can tell where the *local4* facility will log messages of priority *info* or higher
1. Test your guess using:
  ```
  logger -p local4.warn "Testing local4 warnings"
  ```
1. Change the configuration so that local4.debug messages and higher also log to ```/var/log/local4.log```
1. Check your work using:
  ```
  logger -p local4.debug "Testing local4 debug messages"
  ```
    Verify your message appears in ```/var/log/local4.log``` but not in the original log destination
1. Configure logrotate to rotate the file daily and keep only 5 days worth of logs.

> Remember to undo your changes before the logs fill the harddrive
