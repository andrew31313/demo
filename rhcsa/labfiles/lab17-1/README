=== LAB 17: Change the default "runlevel"

OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice changing the state you want the machine to
boot to by default.

STEPS

Use server2 for this lab.  Server2 starts with a "Minimal" server installation
of CentOS.

1.  Install the "Server With GUI" environment, and notice that it 
    still does not boot into a graphical interface when rebooted.
2.  Configure server2 so that it boots to a graphical login
