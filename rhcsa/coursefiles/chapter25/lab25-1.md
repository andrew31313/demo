## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice translating epoch time into human readable time.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS

1.  As root, run the following command to get the timestamps of all the system
    boots and user logins from the audit log:

      awk '/type=(SYSTEM_BOOT|USER_LOGIN)/ { print $1, $2 }' \
        /var/log/audit/audit.log

2.  Convert the epoch timestamps to human readable timestamps.
3.  Run the "last" command to verify you were able to convert the timestamps
    correctly.
