# Reading Assignment
# Chapter 24: Accessing Network Storage
This assignment is part of a [self-study course](../README.md) to prepare for the RHCSA (EX200) exam.</br>

> The lessons in the video series are by the same author as the book and their content closely follows that of the book chapters.Â  However, there are slight differences between the order of the book chapters and the order of the video lessons so the assignments follow the order of the book chapters and the video lessons are linked in the assignments based on content even if their number differs from the number of the book chapter.
