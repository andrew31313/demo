# lab12-1: Practice scheduling a cronjob
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice scheduling a command to run at a specified
interval using cron.  The command could be anything you could run in a terminal
including a shell script.  In this lab, we use the ```logger``` command to generate
system log messages so we can verify the command is getting executed as
intended.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS

1.  On the host machine or in any VM, add a cronjob to run the following command every minute:
  ```
    logger "MY_CRON_TEST"
  ```

1.  Use this command and wait a few minutes to verify your cronjob is running as planned:
  ```
    sudo tail -f /var/log/messages | grep MY_CRON_TEST
  ```

1.  Imagine your ```logger``` command is actually a script to do "end of month" processing of sales data.  Change the cronjob so it "runs the monthly report (logs a message)" at the end of each month.
> Unless you are doing this lab on the last day of the month and can wait until tomorrow, you won't be able to verify your solution (unless you change the system time).

1.  EXTRA CREDIT: How would you schedule a job to run the first Friday of the month?

> When you are done with this lab, make sure you don't leave any of these cronjobs running.
