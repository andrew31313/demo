=== RHCE (EX294) LAB 01: Install ansible on the control machine

OBJECTIVE:

In this lab you practice installing ansible on the control machine and
preparing the other machines in the lab environment so that they may be
configured by ansible.

SETUP:

Ensure labipa is running as it provides infrastructure services such as DNS and
DHCP to all machines on the network.  After that, you may start and configure
the control node and other machines as described below in any order.

STEPS:

1. Create an administrative user named ansible on all machines and ensure it
   can run any command with sudo without providing a password.
2. Ensure python3 is installed and is the default pythong on all systems.
3. Ensure ansible is installed on the control machine.
4. Create an ssh keypair on the control machine and configure the other
   machines such that you can use the keypair to login as the ansible user
   without a password.
