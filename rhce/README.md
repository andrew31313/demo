## The RHCE lab environment

# Getting Started
## Configure the virtualization environment for a specific lab (RHCE)
If you haven't already done so, run the ```setup``` script in the parent directory with ```rhce``` as the only argument to setup this virtual lab environment.  See the ```README.md``` in [demo](https://github.com/dmbrownlee/demo) for more details.

> On either Linux or Mac:  
> ```cd ~/demo && ./setup rhce```  

# Happy Learning!
