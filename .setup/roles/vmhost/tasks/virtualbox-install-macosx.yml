      If you are on Catalina or greater, this is likely due to greater
      security restrictions on kernel extensions installed by software
      not originating from the App Store.  If this is the case, you
      likely have a pop-up dialog telling you to go to
      'System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General'
      and allowing the extensions after unlocking the settings using
      the lock icon on the bottom left.  Do that now and, when you are
      finished, reboot this machine.
      You will need to re-run this setup after the system has rebooted.
