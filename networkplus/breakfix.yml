    # In this exercise, the web server on www has been stopped.  The trouble
    # report is the same as in 21-1, but ping from debian1 to www works.  You
    # can use nc or telnet to check if the host is accepting TCP connections
    # on port 80 and if those connection attempts hang or are immediately
    # rejected.  You might also use wireshark/tcpdump to capture the connection
    # attempt and, if you have console access on www (you do), you can use
    # "ps aux" to see if the web server process is running or "sudo ss -ntlp"
    # to see if there is any process listening on port 80.
