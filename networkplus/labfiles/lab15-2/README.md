##Intermediate instructions for configuring networking and storage on a virtual machine. 

It looks like you may have managed to create your virtual machine successfully, congrats, now it time for the fun part, configuring your personal lab envrionment and machines.

##Setting up the base System in virtualbox

	1. We will need a base line to start, For this exercise we are going to use the default parameters generated by the first virtual machine we created in lab 15-1. So within the VirtualBox Manager we will select the original Machine which for me is `Server1`. Once that is selected we will want to go into its settings. Either by 
            	a. Clicking `settings` up in the top center of the window, 
            	b. Or by holding down the key combo `cmd + s`
            	c. Within settings, we will want to navigate to the `Network` and then select `Adapter 1`
                                    --------Insert image of network adapter 2 here---------
    
	2. In the `Adapter 1` section we will want to
		a. Enable Network Adapter 
		b. Attach the network adapter to `Internal Network`
		c. Name: $intnet-1
		d. Under advanced, ensure that the Promiscuous mode is set to Allow VMS and ensure the cable is connected
            
Note, this configuration is just to network the local machines vms to each other, to access machines, repos and vms outside the local virtual network, additonal configuration will need to be done, which could be incorpirated in a futuer lab

##Configuring the first servers network settings

Next we will want to ensure that the machine is configured to our liking and that the interface is activated on the virtual machine. in linux we will want to open up a terminal. Once open we will want to run the command `sudo nmtui` here we can edit our servers network configuration with a graphical interface. Within the graphical environment we see 3 fields, Edit, Activate and Hostname.

Lets go ahead and edit the configuration first 

	1. to configure, use your keys to hightlight `Edit a connection` press enter, and the select the network interface, after you have selected the network interface, we should see a configuration prompt, here we can choose to configure ipv4, ipv6 automatic connection and availability. 

	a.For this lesson I will just configure ipv4 with the following parameters changed as follows
		Configuration: Manual
		Address: 10.0.0.10
		Gateway 10.0.0.1
		DNS 8.8.8.8
		[x] Require ipv4
		[x]Automatically Connect

	b. Next we will Activate the interface by highlighting the interface and pressing <Activate>. This should activate the interface without rebooting

	c.Next we can change the hostname if you wish, I changed mine to serve1.localdomain. Finally we can hit okay to save our changes

Bonus 

This section we are going to test the configuration thus far and see assign your hosts to their static IP's! We will want a command prompt for this one 

	1. lets try a few ping commands, if you have not ran this command before, use the key combo <control(^)+c> to stop the ping command
		a. `<ping 10.0.0.10>, <ping 10.0.0.1> <ping 10.0.0.11> and <ping 8.8.8.8>`
	
If configured correctly, ping 10.0.0.10 should have been the only ip that had any connection, this is because the only thing currently on this network, is the server itself, no other nodes can be found on this network. Download nmap and take a look, but lets move on with this lab, it is getting lengthy.. oh if you want, lets assign our servers to their ip's right quick by running the following commands
	a. first lets change into a root shell `sudo -i`
	b. now lets add some text to a configuration files `echo 10.0.0.10 server1 >> /etc/hosts && echo 10.0.0.11 server2 /etc/hosts && echo 10.0.0.1 gateway >> /etc/hosts`

Great, on to the next section

left off here >>>##Generating a second machine

						2 Nodes


Fantastic, we have addressedLets start by cloning out machine, this way we can network 2 seperate machines together 

1. You will want to open up the VirtualBox Manager Window, and from here you will want to select the machine we setup in the Lab 15-1 environment, once that is selected we will want to clone the machine, there are two ways of doing this
	a. Right click on the machine and select `clone`
	b. press key combo `cmd + o`

2.From here you will be able to name your machine, select the path in which the machine is saved, assign Mac address policy, and configure disk options. Given we are networking these machines as if they were two separate nodes, I will configure the cloned machine with the following parameters 
						
					--------NOTE------
$user and $VirtualBox_VMs are variables, this will be substituted with your username // account // Directory names. If you are unfamiliar with variables, it might be worth making a quick google search of `what is a variable in programming`. I found this to the be the most transparent definition (imo). All of that being said, the default generated parameters should be set the same as the original VM as far as directories go. Variables are going to come in handy when learning linux though, so I would get familiar with them when // if possible 

	a. Name: Server2
	b. Path: /Users/$user/$Virtulbox_VMs
	c. Mac: Generate new MAC addresses for all network adapters
	d. unselect: keep Disk Names
	e. unselect: keep Hardware UUIDs

3.We will want to make this a full clone, just to ensure the nodes are completely separate on the system.

##Networking two VM's

Congrats! We now have 2 functional machines on the device, but now we need them to talk to one-another, here is where your networking knowledge will come in handy. 





 ## good lab3 idea, generating an additonal network interface, activating it and having a router managed two seperate LANS
## configure external web to work with internal network
