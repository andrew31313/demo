##Intermediate instructions for configuring networking and storage on a virtual machine. 

It looks like you may have managed to create your virtual machine successfully, congrats, now it time for the fun part, configuring your personal lab envrionment and machines.

##Generating a second machine

						2 Nodes


Lets start by cloning out machine, this way we can network 2 seperate machines together 

1. You will want to open up the VirtualBox Manager Window, and from here you will want to select the machine we setup in the Lab 15-1 environment, once that is selected we will want to clone the machine, there are two ways of doing this
	a. Right click on the machine and select `clone`
	b. press key combo `cmd + o`

2.From here you will be able to name your machine, select the path in which the machine is saved, assign Mac address policy, and configure disk options. Given we are networking these machines as if they were two separate nodes, I will configure the cloned machine with the following parameters 
						
					--------NOTE------
$user and $VirtualBox_VMs are variables, this will be substituted with your username // account // Directory names. If you are unfamiliar with variables, it might be worth making a quick google search of `what is a variable in programming`. I found this to the be the most transparent definition (imo). All of that being said, the default generated parameters should be set the same as the original VM as far as directories go. Variables are going to come in handy when learning linux though, so I would get familiar with them when // if possible 

	a. Name: Server2
	b. Path: /Users/$user/$Virtulbox_VMs
	c. Mac: Generate new MAC addresses for all network adapters
	d. unselect: keep Disk Names
	e. unselect: keep Hardware UUIDs

3.We will want to make this a full clone, just to ensure the nodes are completely separate on the system.

##Networking two VM's

Congrats! We now have 2 functional machines on the device, but now we need them to talk to one-another, here is where your networking knowledge will come in handy. 

!!!! Reorginize0.First we will want to ensure that the network card is activated on the virtual machine, in linux we will want to open up a terminal. Once open we will want to run the command `sudo nmtui` here we can  !!!!

1. We will need a base line to start, For this exercise we are going to use the default parameters generated by the first virtual machine we created in lab 15-1. So within the VirtualBox Manager we will select the original Machine which for me is `Server1`. Once that is selected we will want to go into its settings. Either by 
	a. Clicking `settings` up in the top center of the window, 
	b. or by holding down the key combo `cmd + s`

2. From here we will want to go into the `Network`. Here you will see a few tabs relating to adapters.
