#Setting up a Gateway to the outside World, Careful it can be dangerous out there.. 

In this lab, we will going through the steps and procedures of setting up a virtual machine inside of VirtualBox. After this lab you should be able to successfully setup a range of Virtual Machines to experiment with if you get curious.
-- 15-2 goes into a bit more details regarding the configurations of possible inputs and outputs as well as networking these virtual machines together--

With that you have successfully added your first Virtual Machine to Virtual box, all thats left is to launch the Virtual machine and install the OS by following the onscreen instructions. 

There is a second section in 15-2, I highly recommend anyone interested to spend some time there as well, as it will cover a few things that may come in handy later down the road in your IT journey, but as far as this module goes, we can consider it complete, Congrats!
