# Intro to Wireshark

In this lab, we will be looking at packets caputured in Wireshark.

## Wireshark

Go ahead and start Wireshark. Upon loading, you should see all the network interfaces that you're able to capture internet traffic on. Hovering over each interface will display some key information about that interface. To start caputing, simply double click on that interface. After caputing the required packets, hit the red square on the left side of the Wireshark tool bar.

## Exercise

In Wireshark, open the 'Lab 1 Packet Capture.pcapng' file. After opening the file, you should see a packet capture from another machine.

1. Enter a filter into Wireshark so that you're only showing the HTTP GET request traffic.
